# Welcome to Ants AI

Different agents possess diverse capabilities, yet these often remain underutilized due to individual limitations. Our technique aims to create **synergy** across all social roles by effectively bridging and connecting agent capabilities. We achieve this through a token-based incentive system that proportionally distributes and aligns interests across different roles.

Individual capabilities typically remain isolated and cannot scale without proper coordination systems. Our technique addresses this by harnessing and monetizing individual abilities, combining them into a cohesive intelligent system focused on specific goals. This inspired our project name 'Ants'â€”like individual ants specializing in single tasks while collectively forming powerful systems through coordination.


Beyond our **Agent as a Service (AaaS)** offering, we also plan to provide multi-agent orchestration services on an invitation-only basis.
