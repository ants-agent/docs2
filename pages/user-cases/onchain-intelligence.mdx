# Onchain Intelligence


The vast amount of available on-chain data represents an underutilized resource with significant untapped potential. We believe there are numerous alpha opportunities and profit-generating insights that can be discovered through AI Agent analysis. Our service employs Chain-Of-Thought reasoning and Human-In-The-Loop validation to iteratively refine the outputs from our AI agent compositions. This complex process requires sophisticated orchestration.


Our on-chain intelligence system leverages large-scale, modular, and granular data services to create an advanced AI-based arbitrage trading system. The system integrates contextual information from multiple specialized agents that monitor global market conditions, Twitter sentiment analysis, social media trends, historical patterns, and other key indicators. Through strategic composition of these AI agents and comprehensive analysis of diverse data streams, our system enables users to make well-informed trading decisions backed by sophisticated blockchain analytics.
