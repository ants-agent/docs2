# Foundamental Research


We are a team with expertise in Generative AI. We will conduct fundamental research in various directions, including vision, language, and their combination. Each area will focus on solving specific unsolved problems in generative AI and will serve as an agent within our system.

In the near future, we plan to launch a CryptoLLM that incorporates the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies by pretraining on curated CryptoLLM datasets. We intend to invite users to contribute their data, offering token airdrops proportional to the amount of data they provide.

We will also explore the development of large vision-language models tailored to crypto-based user interface scenarios.

Additionally, we will implement bounty programs to support developers on GitHub in providing various agents from major companies, such as OpenAI and others.
