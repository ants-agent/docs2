## Persistency data by vector database

We will maintain persistent records of both user session history and system-level history. This comprehensive overview/memory will enable us to offer more informed and tailored services to users.




## Multi-chain Support

Our initial deployment will focus on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its robust ecosystem advantages including rapid transaction speeds, minimal operational costs, and extensive community support. This makes Solana an ideal platform for on-ramping users into our agent ecosystem. In subsequent development phases, we plan to expand support to EVM-compatible chains, TRON, and other major blockchain networks to achieve broader market coverage and interoperability.



## DAO Governance for Community Self-Sovereignty

We will establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) empowered by the governance token. Token holders can participate in critical decision-making processes through voting, ensuring community-driven governance and true self-sovereignty. This democratic approach enables stakeholders to shape the platform's development, propose improvements, and participate in key protocol decisions.

The DAO structure will facilitate:

- Protocol Parameters: Voting on system configurations and technical parameters
- Agent Standards: Setting and updating quality standards for marketplace agents
- Platform Evolution: Proposing and voting on platform upgrades and new features


## Reliability of the Agents

We will develop several techniques to help agent providers quickly set up their agents in cloud computing systems. While deploying a small number of agents is relatively straightforward, scaling up to a larger operation presents significant challenges. Our solutions aim to ensure reliability and efficiency even as we increase the number of agents.

## User-oriented Agents Composition

While typical users may lack programming expertise, they are the individuals with the true needs that drive development. Initially, we or the developers will encapsulate these needs into the programming requirements, effectively assuming the role of product managers. In the future, we aim to provide a user-friendly interface that empowers end-users to independently compose agents tailored to their specific needs.
