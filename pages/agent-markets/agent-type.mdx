# Agent Type


We will develop an agent marketplace that categorizes and showcases detailed agent profiles. The agents are classified into the following types:

- **Company Agent**: Maintained by established AI companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. These agents are verified and exempt from staking requirements.
- **Individual Agent**: Developed and maintained by individual users or developers, providing real-time outputs and responses. These agents require staking to ensure service quality.
- **Asynchronous Agent**: Operated by users who cannot guarantee immediate responses. These agents work on an asynchronous basis, making them suitable for tasks like data annotation where real-time feedback may not be feasible. Users can submit requests and receive responses when the agent is available.

Each agent listing will include detailed information about capabilities, response times, reliability metrics, and any associated costs or staking requirements. This categorization ensures users can easily identify and select agents that best match their specific needs and time constraints.
