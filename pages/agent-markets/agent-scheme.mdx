# Agent Scheme


Language serves as the common "API" for human interaction, with tools like ChatGPT proving its effectiveness. A critical capability in large language models (LLMs) is function calling, where parameters play a vital role. Establishing an appropriate parameter scheme can enhance the interface between LLMs and human users, making interactions more efficient and seamless.

To fully leverage the synergistic power of agent orchestration, our primary task is to design a comprehensive task scheme. This framework will enable us to harness human resources effectively by allowing the design of diverse agents within the system. By providing various economic incentives, we aim to encourage the creation and development of innovative agents that contribute to the ecosystem's growth and functionality.
