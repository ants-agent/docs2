We are a team with expertise in Generative AI, backed by a strong academic background. **For now, we have chosen to remain anonymous.** We are dedicated to exploring the potential of AI in the financial domain.

We welcome enthusiasts to join our community and contribute to our growing ecosystem. Our current focus is solely on building and developing robust solutions (BUIDL!). While we have no immediate plans for token release, ensuring zero rug-pull risk for our community, we may consider tokenomics as part of our future roadmap when the time is right.
